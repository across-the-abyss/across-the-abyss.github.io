The RPG space is once more grappling with the existence of virulent racists in the space. In short, Goodman Games is
working with Judges Guild (headed by a known racist and anti-semite) to publish a revival of *City State of the
Invincible Overlord*, a classic D&D module. The general tenor of the reaction on
their [two](https://bsky.app/profile/goodmangames.bsky.social/post/3lookicwshk2j) [statements](https://bsky.app/profile/goodmangames.bsky.social/post/3lor64py4wc24)
would have you believe it is as
cut-and-dry as that; the reality is, of course, a bit hairier.

Now, I'm not particularly a Goodman Games fan. I've played a bit of DCC, and I've taken the Might Deed die for my custom
rules set, but that's about the extent of my involvement with the company. So why, why am I choosing to wade into the
muck of this debacle, where surely nothing good awaits me?
Primarily, it's because I'm disappointed by the structure of conversations that social media tends to encourage. It
reduces everything to small quips, misrepresented facts, and only the hottest of takes. But secondly, I'm interested in
moral frameworks and the
quandaries by which they are tested. This is partly what drew me to RPGs in the first place. And this situation provides
such a richly laid out battle between a moral framework and moral absolutes.

## Morality Meets Reality

A moral framework is a means of examining a situation and trying to come out of it while still managing to be proud of
yourself at the other end. It is generally not interesting unless the choices are hard. It balances the consequences of
upholding one's morals against the consequences of breaking them.

In contrast to a framework, a moral absolute is a universal statement that exists outside any concrete situation. In
this case, the arguments
that I've seen here and on the internet as large boils down to the moral absolute: "you should never do business with
racists and antisemites." This is a good rule to live by!.
But the problem with moral absolutes is that they erase ALL nuance, by design. This is what makes them so useful on
social media. They quickly allow one to assess who is in the in-group, and who is in the out-group. It does not,
however, make them especially good building blocks for a moral framework

One of the absolutes that forms the foundations of my moral framework is that I consider it immoral to hold others to a
higher standard than I would hold myself. This means that I need to consider the morality of the *situation as it
exists*, rather than judging it from an abstract perspective. I do this by placing myself in the situation, and figuring
out how much I would be willing to suffer to do the Right Thing. Notably, this is a *relative* moral position, and not
an absolute one.

This is essentially roleplaying, something that I'm pretty sure everyone in the RPG is familiar with.

## Roleplaying the Situation

You signed a contract with a person. You get to work on the project. Later, after signing the contract, it comes to your
attention that this person is a virulent racist. Shit. How can you get out of this?

### Goodman Games's Choice

Try to ensure that no more money, or as close to little money as possible, goes to the racist. If any money does go to
the racist, offset it with donations to groups that combat racism and antisemitism.

*Risk Assessment*

Understanding this choice requires us to assess the risk of the possibility of paying the racist. Choose your own
percentages, but I think the likely outcome is the following on the roll of a d1000:

* 1-995: No money goes to the racist
* 995-999: Less than $1,000 goes to the racist
* 1000: $5,000 goes to the racist

**NOTE:** In this case, Judges Guild is not receiving any money directly. Instead, Goodman Games will be paying backers
of a
previously failed Judges Guild kickstarter. This does not constitute paying off debt, because failed Kickstarters do not
result in legal debts. Judges Guild will receive royalties if this new Kickstarter receives more than $850,000. This is
an absurdly high number for a Goodman Games Kickstarter (more than double the Dying Earth campaign). Even accounting for
whatever customers have already been reimbursed (thus lowering the floor before Judges Guild receives any money), this
Kickstarter was going to get nowhere near this number, even before the controversy.

### The Morally Absolute Choice

Never do business with racists. Suffer the economic consequences of (1) reneging on the deal, (2) throwing away all
work (and money) that has already
been spent on this project, and (3) throwing away the money that has already been spent to acquire the rights to do this
project.

But what are "the economic consequences"? We can't possibly know this, but we can still think through a series of
options. Later options include all of the consequences of the earlier ones. So, assuming that you are trying to be a
good leader, and therefore you will suffer the brunt of the consequences, how much suffering are you willing to put
yourself and your family through?

1. No niceties or nice-to-haves for the year-- no vacation, retirement contribution, college savings, Christmas presents
2. Take out a loan to make ends meet. Pay the loan back over 5 years.
3. Take out a loan to make ends meet. Pay the loan back over 10 years.
4. You and your family tighten your belts: Suffer a 10% calorie deficit for one year
5. You and your family go hungry : Suffer a 25% calorie deficit for one year
6. You and your family starve: Suffer a 50% calorie deficit for one year

**NOTE:** I think these are fairly reasonable economic outcomes. Goodman Games isn't WotC (1600 employees), and it's not
even
Paizo (80 employees). It's 16 people running a small press. At that size, margins tend to be tight, and safety nets tend
to be miniscule.

## So What Do You Do?

Everyone is going to have to answer this for themselves. Given the risk assessment, I would personally probably not go
beyond economic consequence #1 on the
list, and my guess is that Goodman Game's consequences would exceed that. I cannot imagine myself doing better, and so I
am unable to castigate them for their
actions. Maybe more details will emerge and I will have to re-assess the situation, but I will do so under the same
framework.

Maybe you disagree with my assessment, maybe you agree with my assessment and disagree with my choice. If so, I'm
interested in talking about that! I think moral frameworks and the consequences of real actions in real situations are
interesting and valuable topics of discussion.

On the other hand, I do not believe moral absolutism is interesting or valuable. It is intellectually lazy. It creates
hostility. It allows one to dismiss others without inward reflection. Ultimately, it kills conversation, because
bandwagoning is easy, and nuance is hard. RPGs are about conversation, and we should strive to adopt frameworks that
support, rather than hinder, them.
